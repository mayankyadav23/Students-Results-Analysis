# Student Exam Scores Analysis üìä

This project analyzes how various factors, such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and weekly study hours, influence student performance in Math, Reading, and Writing. The dataset includes over 30000+ student records, and the analysis provides insights into educational outcomes based on these factors.

## Project Overview
In this project, we dive into understanding what affects students' scores in three key subjects: Math, Reading, and Writing. Through detailed data analysis and visualizations, we explore the relationships between student attributes and their academic performance.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and standardizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive analysis of student performance factors.
- **Visualizations:** Engaging visuals to highlight key insights.
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy for data manipulation and visualization.

## Some Visuals üñºÔ∏è
###### Below are only some of the visuals represented for a basic undersatnding, my Exploratory Data Analysis files attached contains complete analysis, insights and visuals.
### 1. Performance by Gender

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded and cleaned, ensuring no null values.
2. **EDA:** We explore the influence of various factors (like gender, parental education, lunch type) on student scores.
3. **Visualizations:** Visual plots are created to display the relationships between these factors and student performance.

## Results
- **Gender-based Performance:** Females scored higher in Reading and Writing, while males performed better in Math.
- **Parental Education:** Higher parental education levels are correlated with improved student scores.
- **Lunch Type:** Students receiving standard lunch performed better across subjects.
- **Study Hours:** Weekly study hours show a strong positive correlation with academic performance.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors affecting student exam scores. It highlights the importance of study hours, parental education, and nutrition in influencing academic success.
